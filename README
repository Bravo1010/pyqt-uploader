================================================================================
A PyQt interface for uploading files to Shotgun.
================================================================================
This is a simple user interface to upload files in batch to shotgun.
Once configured, it provides an easy way to upload images or movies to Shotgun.

Uploaded files can be automatically attached to a Shotgun Entity based on
selection or directory structure and can have a note and tags applied.  Video
files can have a thumbnail frame selected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dependencies
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This application requires python 2.5+ and PyQt4 to be installed anc configured.

Requires your Shotgun instance to have API access to the Attachment entity
which is not on by default as of v2.0.3

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Install
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The application should be able to run in any environment where python 2.5+ is
in the PATH as 'python' and PyQt4 is in the PYTHONPTH.  If either of those
is not true, then the script will need to be modified for your environment.

By default, there are fake values for all configuration settings.  These are
all accessible in the preferences dialog and are stored per user.  If you want
to configure the script with defaults to make sharing of the tool easy, there
are a set of variables at the top of the script that can be tweaked.  These
are:
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  DEFAULT_SHOTGUN_API: The path to the Shotgun python API.

  DEFAULT_SHOTGUN_URL: URL to connect to Shotgun through.

  DEFAULT_SHOTGUN_SCRIPT: Name of the script to connect to Shotgun as.
  
  DEFAULT_SHOTGUN_KEY: Key for the script in Shotgun.
  
  DEFAULT_IMAGE_COMMAND: The command used to generate a thumbnail for a non-video
    file.  The symbol $in will be replaced with the input file.  The symbol $out
    will be replaced with a temporary output file, which will be uploaded to Shotgun.
  
  DEFAULT_MOVIE_COMMAND: The command used to generate a thumbnail for a video file.
    In addition to $in and $out, the symbol $offset will be set to the value of the
    offset entered in the app.
  
  DEFAULT_TAGS: A set of default tags to be added to every file uploaded.  These
    can be overridden per file.
  
  DEFAULT_PATH_FIELD: The field on Attachments in Shotgun to fill out with the
    source path for the upload.  Optional, but this can be useful to track where
    files are uploaded from.
  
  DEFAULT_LINK_MAP: A mapping from the directory structure to entities in Shotgun.
    This is a string where each line is in the form
  
    ENTITY_TYPE: PATH
  
    ENTITY_TYPE is the type of Entity in Shotgun that a file should be linked to.
    PATH is a translation of your directory structure into the fields on the entity
      to match against.  For example 'Task: /projects_root/*/shots/$entity.Shot.name/$name'
      will attach any file from the directory '/projects_root/cool_project/shots/010/layout'
      to the Task in Shotgun linked (Shotgun field 'entity') to a Shot entity with field 'name'
      set to '010' and whose field 'name' is set to 'layout'.  If there is a singular match
      to that query, then the file's will link to that Task automatically.
